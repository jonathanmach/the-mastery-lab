# Foundations of enterprise software development

This course covers building scalable software architectures with a focus on modularity and enterprise patterns. Starting with a streaming MVP, it explores evolutionary design, coupling, module communication (synchronous and asynchronous), and deployment strategies. Practical and theory-driven, it equips developers to create robust, adaptable systems.

## Docker

### Docker Volumes

There's 3 types of volumes in Docker:

1. **Named Volumes**: These are volumes that are created and managed by Docker and is not tied to any specific directory on the host machine unless explicitly configured. By default, Docker stores named volumes in a location managed by Docker itself.

```yaml
services:
  my-service:
    volumes:
      - my-volume:/path/in/container
volumes:
  my-volume:
```

2. **Bind Mounts**: These are volumes that are created and managed by the user. They are stored in a directory on the host machine.

```yaml
services:
  my-service:
    volumes:
      - /path/in/host:/path/in/container # ex: .data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

3. **Anonymous Volumes**: These are volumes that are created and managed by Docker. They are stored in a directory on the host machine.

```yaml
services:
  my-service:
    volumes:
      - /path/in/container
```

## Nest.js

Very interesting to see how the framework is structured and how it encourages the use of modules to organize the codebase.

#### Modules

`nest g resource` can be used to generate a new module. This will create a new module with a controller, service, and a few other files.

```bash
nest-app % nest g resource
? What name would you like to use for this resource (plural, e.g., "users")? users
? What transport layer do you use? REST API
? Would you like to generate CRUD entry points? Yes
CREATE src/users/users.controller.spec.ts (566 bytes)
CREATE src/users/users.controller.ts (894 bytes)
CREATE src/users/users.module.ts (248 bytes)
CREATE src/users/users.service.spec.ts (453 bytes)
CREATE src/users/users.service.ts (609 bytes)
CREATE src/users/dto/create-user.dto.ts (30 bytes)
CREATE src/users/dto/update-user.dto.ts (169 bytes)
CREATE src/users/entities/user.entity.ts (21 bytes)
UPDATE package.json (1977 bytes)
UPDATE src/app.module.ts (312 bytes)
âœ” Packages installed successfully.

## Prima ORM
[Set up Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/relational-databases-typescript-postgresql)
````bash
nest-app % npx prisma init

âœ” Your Prisma schema was created at prisma/schema.prisma
  You can now open it in your favorite editor.

warn You already have a .gitignore file. Don't forget to add `.env` in it to not commit any private information.

Next steps:
1. Set the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read https://pris.ly/d/getting-started
2. Set the provider of the datasource block in schema.prisma to match your database: postgresql, mysql, sqlite, sqlserver, mongodb or cockroachdb.
3. Run prisma db pull to turn your database schema into a Prisma schema.
4. Run prisma generate to generate the Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.
5. Tip: Explore how you can extend the ORM with scalable connection pooling, global caching, and real-time database events. Read: https://pris.ly/cli/beyond-orm

More information in our documentation:
https://pris.ly/d/getting-started

````

Applying the schema to the database:
```bash
nest-app % npx prisma db push 
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "fakeflix", schema "public" at "localhost:5433"

ðŸš€  Your database is now in sync with your Prisma schema. Done in 54ms

âœ” Generated Prisma Client (v6.0.0) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 31ms
```
