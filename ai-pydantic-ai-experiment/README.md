# Experimenting with Pydantic AI

[PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) is a Python Agent Framework designed to make it less painful to build production grade applications with Generative AI.

**Use Cases:**

- Categorize credit card transactions using an AI model

## Learnings and key takeaways

During the development and fine tuning, it's normal to receive: `Exceeded maximum retries (6) for result validation`.
However, I had no visibilty on what messages had been exchanged between the agent and the LLM model.

[ ] TODO: Explore how to have more visibility on these messages.
